# WaterBench
## A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Data-Driven Streamflow Forecasting

Welcome to the main repository of the WaterBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset for streamflow forecasting. The dataset covers the 125 catchments in Iowa, US with seven different features, including precipitation, streamflow rate and ET with available data from October 1st, 2011 (the water year 2012) to September 30th, 2018 (the water year 2018). 


## Sample Codes

In the [examples](examples), four different models used in our paper is provided with ready to run notebooks.

## Download the Dataset

The original files of the dataset can be downloaded from [here](/data/data_time_series.zip) as an archive file. The metadata is provided in the archive file.  

The files that we used in sample codes can be downloaded from [here](/data/data_ready.zip) as an archive file. The metadata is provided in the archive file.
