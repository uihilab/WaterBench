# WaterBench

## Introduction
WaterBench provides data from 125 catchments in the state of Iowa. The precipitation time-series data ranges from Oct 2011 to Sep 2018 along with catchment-based features such as the topography, soil type, and slopes. Even though the dataset was designed in a way to discard most of the preprocessing and data engineering tasks out of the way for machine learning applications and research, it could be used in other studies with similar goals, such as physically based modeling with physical equations. 

## Data Format
The metadata, including the area, slope, travel time, and slope, are constant for each catchment, and the streamflow, precipitation, and ET are in time series.

In time-series [1G] or in 120 hours [18G]? or both?
